Description:
In this project, I hope to combine two ideas into one COVID-19 preventing IoT device. Through an IR temperature sensor and a camera, I hope to collect information and alert instructors, managers, and bosses if anyone has an elevated temperature or if social distancing is not being followed.

Equipment:
Raspberry Pi,
Pi Camera and/or Webcam,
MLX90614 - IR temperature sensor,
Connecting wires,
Breadboard
